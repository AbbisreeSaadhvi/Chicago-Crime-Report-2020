**Research Question:**
Find out where and when crime happens the most in Chicago. 

**Reason:**

I have chosen the Chicago Crime Dataset 2020 for understanding the following:  
1. Strategic Resource Allocation: Identifying peak times and crime hotspots enables targeted deployment of law enforcement resources, improving response and deterrence. 
2. Proactive Policing: Focusing on high-crime areas allows for proactive patrols and operations, disrupting criminal activities and reducing overall crime rates. 
3. Community Involvement: Using crime trend data, policymakers and community groups can implement tailored interventions, such as neighborhood watch programs, to address underlying causes of crime. 
4. Public Safety Improvement: Addressing crime hotspots leads to safer communities, and fosters trust between residents and law enforcement. 
5. Informed Decision-Making: Analysis of crime patterns will empower authorities to make data-driven decisions on resource allocation, policy, and community initiatives, enhancing effectiveness in crime prevention. 

**Goal:**
1. Understand the factors that influence whether an arrest or not 
2. Determine whether there is a correlation between crimes committed and locations. 3. Distinguish whether the type of crime at a location is arrestable.
